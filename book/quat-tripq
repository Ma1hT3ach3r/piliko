Every Quaternion has an associated Descartes Configuration. 
(capitals = smallcase squared)

               W + X + Y + Z <=> B1 + B2 + B3 + B4
 

If W = 0

Every Quaternion has an associated Descartes Configuration of
Ford Circles, and an associated Triple Quad Squares


                                       X + Y + Z
                (B1^2 + B2^2 + B3^2)=k(B1+B2+B3)^2
