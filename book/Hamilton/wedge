==Quaternions==


In other news, I found a fun relationship between the "Wedge" function and Quaternion multiplication. In the last post I was pondering how to deal with Quaternions that have only an X and Y component, and are basically vectors on a 2 dimensional plane. 


Q = w + xi + yj + zk 


if w = 0 and z = 0 then Q = xi + yj


For example the 3-4-5 triangle could be described as Q = 4x+3j


Q * Q' = (xi+yj)(x'i+y'j)


This results in something like this:


  Q*Q' = k(xy'-yx') - (xx'+yy')


You may recognize the 'k' term as ... the wedge!  (OK did I get it backwards? well, its still wedgy). It is the area of a paraellologram described by the two vectors x,y and x',y'.    xy'-yx'. Used in a lot of other places in mathematics and geometry. 

 

What is the xx'+yy' thing though? Haven't figured it out yet.
